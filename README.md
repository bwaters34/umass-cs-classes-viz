# umass-cs-classes-viz
A social-network based visualization of UMass CS classes and their subplans.

The yellow nodes are subplans (other schools might call them concentrations).  The small blue nodes are the individual classes.

This graph makes it easy to choose classes that fulfill multiple subplans you are interested in.



**Download presentation.html for the interactive version!  It has draggable nodes!**
